<text name="tip_railguns">Tip: Railguns' projectiles will ignore all enemy shields, but cost one missile to launch. Enemy defense drones have difficulty targeting incoming railgun projectiles.</text>
<text name="tip_combatChrono">Tip: For every one point of ion damage, one power bar is removed from the target system and it is then locked for 5 seconds, preventing re-powering. This weapon bypasses shields entirely.</text>
